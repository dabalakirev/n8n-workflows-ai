# Documentation Consistency Check Procedure

## üéØ Purpose
Prevent information duplication and ensure consistency across all documentation files in the n8n-workflows-ai platform.

## üìã Documentation Scope & Responsibility

### **Document Responsibility Matrix**
| Document | Primary Focus | Should NOT Contain |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **README.md** | Platform overview, current status, getting started | Detailed roadmap, workflow architecture details |
| **docs/roadmap.md** | Milestones, timeline, platform development progress | Platform overview, workflow specifics |
| **workflows/README.md** | Workflow architecture, project structure | Platform overview, specific project details |
| **workflows/[project]/README.md** | Project-specific workflow details | Platform overview, general architecture |

### **‚úÖ Information Ownership Rules**
1. **Platform Status** - Only in main README.md
2. **Development Timeline** - Only in docs/roadmap.md
3. **Workflow Architecture** - Only in workflows/README.md
4. **Project Specifics** - Only in project-specific README files

## üîç Pre-Commit Consistency Checklist

### **Before ANY documentation update:**
- [ ] **Identify information type** - Platform/Roadmap/Architecture/Project-specific
- [ ] **Check ownership matrix** - Where should this information live?
- [ ] **Verify no duplication** - Does this information exist elsewhere?
- [ ] **Update cross-references** - Are navigation links accurate?
- [ ] **Review related documents** - Do they need updates too?

## üö® Red Flags - Duplication Warning Signs

### **‚ùå AVOID These Patterns:**
- **Status information** in multiple files (dates, completion percentages)
- **Roadmap details** outside of docs/roadmap.md
- **Platform architecture** repeated in project files
- **Testing framework descriptions** duplicated across documents
- **Workflow structure information** repeated in platform docs

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning Signals:**
- Similar progress bars or status indicators in multiple files
- Timeline information appearing outside roadmap
- Platform tool descriptions repeated across documents
- Copy-pasted sections between README files

## üîÑ Regular Consistency Maintenance

### **Weekly Documentation Review:**
1. **Scan for duplicate information** across all README files
2. **Verify status consistency** - dates, percentages, milestones
3. **Check cross-reference validity** - all links work and point correctly
4. **Update navigation paths** - ensure document discoverability

### **Before Major Updates:**
1. **Identify impact scope** - which documents might need updates
2. **Plan information distribution** - where should new info live
3. **Update in correct order** - authoritative document first
4. **Verify consistency** - no conflicting information remains

## üìä Document Quality Standards

### **Each Document Must Have:**
- **Clear, unique purpose** - no overlap with other docs
- **Consistent navigation** - links to related but non-duplicate info
- **Current information** - synchronized with actual platform state
- **Appropriate scope** - stays within its responsibility area

### **Cross-Document Standards:**
- **Consistent terminology** - same terms used across all docs
- **Synchronized dates** - no conflicting timestamps
- **Unified status reporting** - consistent progress indicators
- **Clear boundaries** - each doc covers its scope only

## üõ†Ô∏è AI Agent Guidelines for Documentation

### **Before Creating/Updating Documentation:**
1. **Review Responsibility Matrix** - understand document scope
2. **Check Existing Content** - avoid duplication
3. **Plan Information Distribution** - where should each piece live
4. **Update Navigation** - ensure discoverability
5. **Verify Consistency** - no conflicting information

### **AI Agent Documentation Protocol:**
- **NEVER duplicate information** between documents
- **ALWAYS check responsibility matrix** before adding content
- **UPDATE related documents** when making changes
- **MAINTAIN consistent navigation** between documents
- **REPORT inconsistencies** found during updates

## üéØ Success Metrics

### **Documentation Consistency KPIs:**
- **Zero duplicate information** across platform documents
- **100% accurate cross-references** between documents
- **Consistent status reporting** across all files
- **Clear document boundaries** with no scope overlap

### **Monthly Review Questions:**
1. Does each document have a unique, clear purpose?
2. Are all status indicators synchronized?
3. Do navigation links work and lead to correct information?
4. Is information in the most appropriate document?
5. Are there any duplicate sections across files?

## üìù Implementation Notes

### **For AI Agents:**
- This procedure is **mandatory** before any documentation changes
- Use this checklist for **every documentation task**
- **Report violations** of consistency rules immediately
- **Suggest improvements** to this procedure when found

### **For Human Contributors:**
- Review this procedure before major documentation updates
- Use consistency checklist for pull request reviews
- Flag documentation duplication during code reviews
- Maintain this procedure as platform evolves

---

**This procedure ensures documentation remains clean, consistent, and maintainable as the platform scales.**
