# Security Best Practices Guide

## üîê Overview

This document provides comprehensive security best practices for n8n workflows, API integrations, infrastructure management, and AI agent operations. These guidelines focus on universal security principles applicable across different environments and use cases.

## üéØ Security Principles

### Core Security Foundations:
- **Defense in Depth** - Multiple layers of security controls
- **Principle of Least Privilege** - Minimal access rights required
- **Zero Trust Architecture** - Never trust, always verify
- **Security by Design** - Built-in security from the start
- **Continuous Monitoring** - Ongoing security assessment

## 1. üîë Credentials Management

### 1.1 API Keys & Secrets Storage

**Best Practices:**
- **Never hardcode** credentials in workflows, code, or configuration files
- Use **dedicated secrets management systems** (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault)
- Store credentials in **environment variables** or secure credential stores
- Implement **encryption at rest** for all stored credentials
- Use **separate credentials** for different environments (dev/staging/prod)

**Credential Lifecycle Management:**
- **Regular rotation** schedule (30-90 days for high-risk APIs)
- **Automated rotation** where possible
- **Immediate revocation** upon suspected compromise
- **Audit trail** for all credential access and modifications
- **Expiration dates** for temporary credentials

### 1.2 Access Control Patterns

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
- Define **minimal required permissions** for each role
- Regular **access reviews** and cleanup
- **Time-limited access** for temporary needs
- **Multi-factor authentication** for privileged access

**Service Account Management:**
- **Dedicated service accounts** for automated systems
- **Regular audit** of service account permissions
- **Rotation of service account credentials**
- **Monitoring** of service account activities

## 2. üåê API Security

### 2.1 External API Integration Security

**Authentication & Authorization:**
- Use **strong authentication mechanisms** (OAuth 2.0, API keys with proper scoping)
- Implement **token refresh** strategies for long-running workflows
- **Validate API responses** to prevent injection attacks
- Use **HTTPS only** for all API communications

**Rate Limiting & Throttling:**
- Implement **client-side rate limiting** to respect API limits
- Use **exponential backoff** for retry logic
- **Monitor API usage** patterns for anomalies
- **Circuit breaker patterns** for failing APIs

### 2.2 Input Validation & Sanitization

**Data Validation Framework:**
- **Whitelist validation** - accept only known good input
- **Input length limits** to prevent buffer overflow attacks
- **Data type validation** for all parameters
- **Encoding validation** for text inputs
- **SQL injection prevention** for database queries

**Output Sanitization:**
- **Escape special characters** in outputs
- **Validate data formats** before processing

### 3.2 CI/CD Security

**GitHub Actions Security:**
- **Minimal permissions** for workflow tokens

- **Encrypted communication** channels
- **Access control** for MCP operations
- **Session management** and timeout handling
- **Logging** of MCP interactions for audit

**AI Agent Session Security:**
