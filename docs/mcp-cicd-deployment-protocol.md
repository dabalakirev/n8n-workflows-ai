# MCP CI/CD Deployment Protocol

## üéØ Purpose
Formalize the complete CI/CD process for n8n workflow development using MCP-first approach with role-based responsibilities, covering development through production deployment and release management.

---

## üèóÔ∏è **Phase 1: Architecture Design**

### **üé≠ Role:** üèóÔ∏è **Solution Architect**
**Trigger:** New requirements, architecture changes, Issue #23-type comprehensive projects

#### **üìã Responsibilities:**
1. **Requirements Analysis**
   - Analyze user requirements and technical constraints
   - Evaluate current system architecture and capabilities
   - Identify integration points and dependencies

2. **Technical Planning**
   - Design workflow architecture and data flow
   - Determine MCP vs UI requirements analysis
   - Plan DEV ‚Üí PROD migration strategy
   - Define testing and validation approach

3. **MCP Capability Assessment**
   - Review available n8n MCP commands: `n8n_create_workflow`, `n8n_update_full_workflow`, `n8n_get_workflow`
   - Identify limitations requiring UI escalation
   - Plan programmatic workflow management approach

4. **Issues Creation**
   - Create [FEATURE] Issues for new functionality
   - Create [ENHANCEMENT] Issues for improvements
   - Define success criteria and acceptance tests
   - Establish development priorities and dependencies

#### **üîÑ Architecture Review Protocol**
**Trigger:** Developer escalation during implementation phase

**Process:**
```
Developer Issue Comment: "‚ùå Architecture Insufficient - [Specific Problem]"
‚Üí Solution Architect Review ‚Üí Architecture Update ‚Üí Issue Update
‚Üí Development Restart with New Architecture
```

**Review Criteria:**
- Technical feasibility through MCP
- Integration complexity assessment
- Performance and scalability considerations
- Security and best practices compliance

#### **‚úÖ Exit Criteria:**
- [ ] Technical solution designed and documented
- [ ] Issues created with clear requirements
- [ ] MCP implementation approach defined
- [ ] Architecture approved and ready for development

---

## üíª **Phase 2: MCP-First Development**

### **üé≠ Role:** üíª **Developer**
**Trigger:** Issue assigned for development, architecture approved

#### **üìã MCP-First Development Process:**

##### **1. Current State Analysis**
```bash
# Analyze existing workflows
n8n_list_workflows ‚Üí identify existing workflows
n8n_get_workflow_details(id) ‚Üí examine current structure
n8n_get_workflow_structure(id) ‚Üí understand connections

# GitHub sync check
github-mcp:get_file_contents ‚Üí compare with repository
```

##### **2. MCP Workflow Implementation**
```bash
# Create new workflows
n8n_create_workflow({
  name: "Project Workflow DEV",
  nodes: [...],
  connections: {...}
})

# Update existing workflows  
n8n_update_full_workflow(id, {
  nodes: [...],
  connections: {...}
})

# Validate implementation
n8n_get_workflow_details(id) ‚Üí verify configuration
```

##### **3. Trigger Configuration (DEV Environment)**
**Required Pattern:** Dual triggers for DEV workflows
- **Manual Trigger** - For development and manual testing
- **Execute Workflow Trigger** - For Test Orchestrator automation

**MCP Implementation:**
```javascript
const devWorkflowNodes = [
  {
    id: "manual-trigger",
    type: "n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger",
    // Manual trigger configuration
  },
  {
    id: "execute-workflow-trigger", 
    type: "n8n-nodes-base.executeWorkflowTrigger",
    // Execute workflow trigger for Test Orchestrator
  },
  // Additional workflow nodes...
]
```

##### **4. GitHub Synchronization**
```bash
# Commit workflow JSON to repository
github-mcp:create_or_update_file({
  path: "workflows/project-name/dev/workflow-name-dev.json",
  content: workflowJSON,
  message: "Update workflow - Issue #N implementation"
})
```

#### **üö® UI Escalation Protocol**

**Trigger:** MCP cannot perform required operation

**Process:**
1. **Identify MCP Limitation**
   - Document specific operation that cannot be performed
   - Research alternative MCP approaches
   - Confirm UI intervention required

2. **Generate Detailed Human Instructions**
   ```markdown
   üî¥ MANUAL UI ACTION REQUIRED - Issue #N
   
   **Reason:** [Specific MCP limitation]
   **Required Action:** [Exact operation needed]
   **Location:** n8n UI ‚Üí [Specific navigation path]
   
   **Step-by-step Instructions:**
   1. [Detailed step 1 with screenshots if needed]
   2. [Detailed step 2]
   3. [etc...]
   
   **Expected Result:** [What should happen]
   **Verification:** [How to confirm success]
   **Report Back:** [What information to provide in Issue comment]
   
   **Next Steps:** Developer will continue after confirmation
   ```

3. **Issue Tagging and Waiting**
   - Add label "üî¥ manual-ui-required" to Issue
   - Wait for human completion and confirmation
   - Verify results through available MCP commands
   - Continue development after confirmation

#### **üîß Common UI Escalation Scenarios:**
- **Webhook URL Configuration** - Custom webhook endpoints
- **Credential Management** - New API credentials setup
- **Node-Specific Settings** - Advanced node configurations not exposed via MCP
- **Environment Variables** - Platform-specific environment settings
- **Custom Node Installation** - Community nodes not available via MCP

#### **‚úÖ Exit Criteria:**
- [ ] Workflow implemented through MCP commands
- [ ] Dual triggers configured for DEV environment
- [ ] JSON synchronized with GitHub repository
- [ ] Basic functionality validated
- [ ] Ready for comprehensive testing
